Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease with a continuously increasing global prevalence. Predicting the progression of diabetes is essential for early intervention and treatment planning. This study aims to predict the progression of diabetes one year after the initial diagnosis using the Linear Regression algorithm. The research applies standard data mining processes such as preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and deployment using the Python programming language and the Scikit-learn library. Evaluation metrics such as MSE, MAE, RMSE, R², and Adjusted R² are used to assess model performance. Results show that Linear Regression produces a predicted value of 69.44 for new input data, with an R² score of 0.45, indicating moderate prediction performance. The model was also deployed via a user-friendly web interface using Flask, allowing clinical staff to input patient data and receive predictive feedback. The results confirm that Linear Regression offers an interpretable and reasonably accurate approach for diabetes progression prediction
